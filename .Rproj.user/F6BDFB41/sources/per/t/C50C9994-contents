# Protocol: Developing and validating risk prediction models for attrition in randomised controlled trials for type 2 diabetes mellitus

## Overview
This protocol describes the background, trial selection and intended methodology 
for developing and validating risk prediction models for attrition in randomised 
controlled trials for type 2 diabetes mellitus.

## Background
Randomised controlled trials (hereafter trials) are the gold standard for evidence-based medicine because randomisation allows us to assume exchangeability between treatment groups. However, this fundamental design strength and the general validity of trials can be threatened by trial attrition (participant non-completion of a trial for any reason, e.g. adverse events, loss to follow-up). The exchangeability of treatment groups can be disrupted if attrition occurs differently across treatment groups, either by overall occurrence or occurrence among participant subgroups. Both scenarios can introduce attrition bias, a form of selection bias in which trial results reflect the characteristics of participants who completed a trial. Even when these scenarios are avoided, attrition can impact trial validity by reducing statistical power, impacting trial representativeness and ultimately confidence in trial findings. Attrition is a common and often unavoidable issue in trials. Publicly funded trials typically report between 3-20% attrition, while trials published in high impact medical journals report between 1-14% attrition. Greater variation in prevalence and cause is seen among trials of different indications and interventions.
Given the potential threats to trial validity and prevalence, addressing attrition is a priority area in trial methodology research. Yet despite efforts to identify effective retention strategies and to understand factors that influence attrition, it is unclear how attrition can be mitigated in ways that are generalisable to trials. One approach to addressing this would be developing attrition risk prediction models. At the design stage of trials, predicting attrition risk would enable trialists to understand which trial design features influence attrition. This would inform decision making around trade-offs between attrition and other design goals. At the conduct stage of trials, a risk prediction model would allow trialists to examine attrition risk profiles, informing decision making around maximising participant retention. We are not aware of any publicly available models for attrition risk prediction. As such, in this protocol, we describe how we will develop and validate attrition risk prediction models for the design and conduct stages of trials. The design stage model will be developed using aggregate-level data and enable predictions of attrition risk and rates based on trial design features (e.g. phase, blinding). The conduct model, developed using both aggregate-level and participant-level data, will enable predictions of individual participant risk profiles in trials with particular design features. We are developing the model using data from trials for type 2 diabetes mellitus because it is a clinical context where little is known about attrition and its impacts.
To inform this protocol, we have conducted an umbrella review examining predictors of attrition. We found no characteristic to be consistently associated with attrition across all trials but identified a number of characteristics included in several studies: participant age, sex and index condition, as well as trial duration, publication/reporting year, sample size and intervention properties (i.e. type, frequency, intensity, delivery and format). We have also conducted an analysis of 90 individual participant data (IPD) trials modelling total attrition rates and attrition rates by category (i.e. Adverse event, lack of efficacy, loss to follow-up, PI/sponsor decision, protocol violation, voluntary withdrawal and other). These intercept-only models allowed us to identify that change in attrition rates over time frequently followed a Gompertz distribution. Based on these findings, we will develop attrition risk prediction models for the design and conduct stages of trials using aggregate-level and participant-level data. 


## Methods
We will develop and validate risk prediction models for attrition in trials for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). To do this, we will construct design and conduct-stage models. The design stage model will be developed using aggregate-level data and estimate the effects of trial-level covariates on attrition risk, accounting for differences in trial duration. The conduct stage model will be constructed from two sub-models: a participant-level model that estimates the effects of baseline participant characteristics on attrition risk; and the design-stage model with a recalibrated intercept informed by the outputs of the participant-level model. Both models will be internally validated and outputs will be packaged into an attrition risk prediction tool built in R Shiny.
